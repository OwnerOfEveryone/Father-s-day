    <h1>Dear Dad,</h1>
    <b><p>
      It’s me — your son, <strong>Aditya</strong>. I may not always say it out loud, but I want you to know how much you mean to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a 14-year-old, I’m still learning, growing, and figuring things out — but one thing I know for sure is how lucky I am to have you as my dad. You’ve always been there, cheering me on, teaching me right from wrong, and helping me become the best version of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I act like I’ve got it all figured out, but honestly, I’m always looking up to you. Your advice, your strength, and the way you handle everything — it inspires me more than I can explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      So on this Father’s Day, I just want to say:<br>
      <em>Thank you for being my hero, my teacher, and my biggest supporter.</em><br>
      You’re not just my dad — you’re my role model and my best friend.
    </p>
